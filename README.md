# WebWarriors
We are group 2 for the Fall of 2025 GEO 4422 Web Mapping course. Currently our group name is "Web Warriors". The current plan for our project is to create our own version of the website "truesizeof.com". Truesizeof allows users to observe the distortions created by the Mercator-projection. The entire page is a webmap. Users locate a search box that allows them to type in the name of any country. Once a country is selected, it is highlighted on the map with a unique color attribute. The user can then drag the highlighted outline of the country of choice to anywhere else on the map. As the country's shapefile is dragged around, the projections distortions are applied, causing it to change the shape, size, and orientation accordingly. This can allow users to compare the size of countries accurately. For instance, Greenland looks roughly similar in shape and size to that of the entire African continent. If you searched "Greenland" and dragged it down to Africa, you would see it shrink substantially. From there, the user could nestle Greenland into the center of Africa to get a good perspective of how much smaller it truly is. To make our version unique, we could do a few things. We could use a different projection, or perhaps use states and provinces instead of countries.
