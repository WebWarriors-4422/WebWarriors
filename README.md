# WebWarriors
We are group 2 for the Fall of 2025 GEO 4422 Web Mapping course. Our goal is to make a webpage that highlights roadways within the City of San Marcos that have insufficient pedestrian infrastructure (sidewalks and bike lanes). Our webpage will provide an interactive map where which viewers can select the highlighted roads & see where problem areas are. We focused only on major roads where insufficient pedestrian infrastructure exceeds a mile.
